Cole French is a rising senior pursuing a Computer Science degree at [Harvard College](https://college.harvard.edu). Cole thought it would be funny to describe himself in the third person. If you disagree, then you're objectively wrong. That was another joke.

# What I Do for Work
As a full-time student, I've learned a lot about machine learning and securityâ€”but fundamentally, I'm a problem solver. I hope that my knowledge, imagination, and drive make me a good one.

# What I Do for Fun
I love to casually compete in sports like tennis and chess (I assure you, it's a sport. Source: company that benefits from people believing [chess is a sport](https://www.chess.com/article/view/is-chess-a-sport)). I run Harvard's [Minecraft club](https://humc.club) and write for [Satire V](https://satirev.org). I also write poetry, which you can look forward to seeing on this website in the future.
