* Transform mdast to hast.\n *\n * ##### Notes\n *\n * ###### HTML\n *\n * Raw HTML is available in mdast as `html` nodes and can be embedded in hast\n * as semistandard `raw` nodes.\n * Most utilities ignore `raw` nodes but two notable ones don’t:\n *\n * *   `hast-util-to-html` also has an option `allowDangerousHtml` which will\n *     output the raw HTML.\n *     This is typically discouraged as noted by the option name but is useful\n *     if you completely trust authors\n * *   `hast-util-raw` can handle the raw embedded HTML strings by parsing them\n *     into standard hast nodes (`element`, `text`, etc).\n *     This is a heavy task as it needs a full HTML parser, but it is the only\n *     way to support untrusted content\n *\n * ###### Footnotes\n *\n * Many options supported here relate to footnotes.\n * Footnotes are not specified by CommonMark, which we follow by default.\n * They are supported by GitHub, so footnotes can be enabled in markdown with\n * `mdast-util-gfm`.\n *\n * The options `footnoteBackLabel` and `footnoteLabel` define natural language\n * that explains footnotes, which is hidden for sighted users but shown to\n * assistive technology.\n * When your page is not in English, you must define translated values.\n *\n * Back references use ARIA attributes, but the section label itself uses a\n * heading that is hidden with an `sr-only` class.\n * To show it to sighted users, define different attributes in\n * `footnoteLabelProperties`.\n *\n * ###### Clobbering\n *\n * Footnotes introduces a problem, as it links footnote calls to footnote\n * definitions on the page through `id` attributes generated from user content,\n * which results in DOM clobbering.\n *\n * DOM clobbering is this:\n *\n * ```html\n * <p id=x></p>\n * <script>alert(x) // `x` now refers to the DOM `p#x` element</script>\n * ```\n *\n * Elements by their ID are made available by browsers on the `window` object,\n * which is a security risk.\n * Using a prefix solves this problem.\n *\n * More information on how to handle clobbering and the prefix is explained in\n * Example: headings (DOM clobbering) in `rehype-sanitize`.\n *\n * ###### Unknown nodes\n *\n * Unknown nodes are nodes with a type that isn’t in `handlers` or `passThrough`.\n * The default behavior for unknown nodes is:\n *\n * *   when the node has a `value` (and doesn’t have `data.hName`,\n *     `data.hProperties`, or `data.hChildren`, see later), create a hast `text`\n *     node\n * *   otherwise, create a `<div>` element (which could be changed with\n *     `data.hName`), with its children mapped from mdast to hast as well\n *\n * This behavior can be changed by passing an `unknownHandler`.\n *\n * @param {MdastNodes} tree\n *   mdast tree.\n * @param
