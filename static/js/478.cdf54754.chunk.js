I'm a junior at [Harvard College](https://college.harvard.edu), where I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science. Please read on to learn a little more about me.\n\n# Research\nI'm new to research, and my interests are still developing. Right now, I want to understand machine learning's place in society. How do we impact communities with our design choices as implementers? How can we improve human knowledge by interpreting the models learned by machines? How secure are our interactions with ML?\n\n# Activities\nSome sports I love to compete in are tennis and chess (yes: [it's a sport!](https://www.chess.com/article/view/is-chess-a-sport)). I run Harvard's [Minecraft club](https://humc.club) and write for [Satire V](https://satirev.org). Sometimes, I feel more creative and write poetry, so I might end up posting some of that here.\n"})]})})}}}]);
