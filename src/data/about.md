Cole French is a rising senior pursuing a Computer Science degree at [Harvard College](https://college.harvard.edu). Cole wrote this himself, but he assures you he will switch to the first person once he has piqued your interest (and sacrificed some of my dignity). For more ramblings or to learn more about me, please explore the site.

# What I Do for Work
Work? I'm still a full-time student! My studies primarily focus on the state of the art in machine learning. I'm excited to combine my creative drive with my growing knowledge and experience to artfully solve difficult engineering problems.

# What I Do for Fun
I love to casually compete in sports like tennis and chess (please hear me out: [it's a sport](https://www.chess.com/article/view/is-chess-a-sport)). I run Harvard's [Minecraft club](https://humc.club) and write for [Satire V](https://satirev.org). I also write poetry, which you can look forward to seeing on this website in the future.
