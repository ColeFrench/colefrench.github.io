### Who is Cole French?
Thanks for asking. I am a senior at [Harvard College](https://college.harvard.edu) studying Computer Science. An engineer at heart, I enjoy designing solutions to technical challenges and tinkering with existing ones.

#### Interests
Much of my academic work is in machine learning. I am captivated by deep learning models, whose abilities already exceed humans' at almost any task. Do you think humanity has a place in this superintelligent future? &mdash;Sorry, too existential.

I love to program, especially when it involves dealing with constraintsâ€”whether working within them, as in systems programming, or trying to escape them, as in security research.

#### Hobbies
At Harvard, I preside over the [Minecraft club](https://humc.club) ("Wait, there's a Minecraft club?"), write [satire](https://satirev.org), and play for the [chess club](https://www.harvardchessclub.org).

Outside of that, I enjoy writing poetry, playing tennis, and accidentally finding SQL injection vulnerabilities in Harvard's student database.
