					We humans are one of the most adaptive species on the planet. This ability to evolve and change to best fit in our environment has allowed us to thrive and develop across the globe. However, with the rapid rise of computers in the Digital Age, our species may no longer be king. Modern computers are able to perform calculations much more quickly than humans, and with access to the Internet and all of its data, computers have a much greater capacity for intelligence. As we race through this Digital Age, we may have to find a way to keep up with evolving artificial intelligence. The CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, Elon Musk, addresses our predicament with a simple question:
				</p>
				<figure class="d-block figure text-center">
					<img class="figure-img img-fluid" src="assets/images/musk-future.png" alt="What do we want the future to look like?" />
					<figcaption class="figure-caption">Business Insider</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					Musk is already on the frontier of engineering humanity's future with his industry-revolutionizing companies, SpaceX and Tesla. Now, faced with artificial intelligence's rising superiority, he has proposed yet another venture to keep humans up to date with technology, called "neural lace". This device is a brain-computer interface that will allow us to interact with information just as well as computers do. "Neural lace" (already being developed by Musk's startup, Neuralink) will allow people to download data from the Internet and upload thoughts to various interfaces. Not only will this allow us to acquire and process information faster, but it will remove the necessity of intermediary interfaces such as keyboards and microphones to communicate with technology. As a result, the efficiency of communication will drastically improve.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Neural lace" will be an implantable mesh of tiny brain electrodes that conforms to and grows with the brain.

				<p>
					This futuristic technology is definitely something to get excited about, but there is definitely cause to be dubious of the consequences of "neural lace". Many modern technologies come with a trade-off between functionality and privacy (e.g., using technology often involves sending usage information to the technology's developer). George Orwell's famous dystopian novel, <em>1984</em>, is an excellent example of this compromise. In the novel, telescreens&mdash;the equivalent of smart televisions today&mdash;occupy almost every household. In exchange for facile communication and entertainment, the telescreens are utilized by the totalitarian government to spy on its citizens. "Neural lace" has the potential to grant a similar opportunity to unwelcomed third parties. Government (or other) organizations may be able to exploit users of this brain-computer interface by spying directly on their thoughts. This prospect is much more formidable than the scenario in <em>1984</em>, because telescreens only allow the government to spy on citizens' actions. This leaves thoughts and intentions to interpretation. "Neural lace", however, would provide direct access to the entire brains of its users, including their thoughts.
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite the appeal of "neural lace" and other technologies, it is clear that a level of awareness and caution is necessary to avoid making regrettable decisions. We must consider the implications of technology before mindlessly adopting it, especially as privacy becomes more precious and controversial.
