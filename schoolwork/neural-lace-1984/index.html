					We humans are one of the most adaptive species on the planet. This ability to evolve and change to best fit in our environment has allowed us to thrive and develop across the globe. However, with the rapid rise of computers in the Digital Age, our species may no longer be King. Modern computers are able to perform calculations much more quickly than humans, and with access to the Internet and all of its data, computers have a much greater capacity for intelligence. As we race through this Digital Age, we may have to find a way to keep up with evolving artificial intelligence. The CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, Elon Musk, addresses our predicament with a simple question:

					<figcaption class="figure-caption">Business Insider</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					Musk proposes that, in order to keep humans up to date with technology, we should be implanted with brain-computer interfaces that allow us to interact with information just as well as computers. This technology, called "neural lace", will allow people to download data from the Internet and upload thoughts. Not only will this allow us to acquire and process information faster, but it will remove the necessity of interfaces such as keyboards and microphones to communicate with technology. "Neural lace" will be an implantable set of tiny brain electrodes that conforms to the brain and grows with the body:

				</figure>
				<p>
					Although this technology is exciting and on the frontier of neuroscience, we should be cautious of its implications. In George Orwell's famous dystopian novel, <em>1984</em>, telescreens (i.e., a kind of modern television) occupy every household. Although these telescreens allow facile communication and entertainment, they are also used by the government to spy on its citizens. "Neural lace" may grant a similar opportunity to unwelcomed third parties. Government (or other) organizations may be able to spy directly on our thoughts. This is much more dangerous than telescreens in <em>1984</em>, because those only allow the government to spy on our actions and try to predict our thoughts. "Neural lace", on the other hand, will provide direct access to our thoughts. Although this is all speculation, it is very important to stay aware of the consequences that technologies bring to our privacy.
