					<p class="text-justify">
						The Manhattan Project created the first nuclear weapon during World War II and was a joint effort between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. The early work was originally done here in Pupin Physics Laboratories at Columbia University in New York City. Many of the physicists working at the beginning stages of the Manhattan Project were refugees from Nazi Germany or had escaped the political turmoil of Europe

					<img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/images/einstein.jpg" alt="Albert Einstein" />
					<p class="text-justify">
						Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was the mastermind behind the quintessential equation, \(E = mc^2\). He formulated his famous special theory of relativity in 1905, and most people credit him as the father of the Atomic Age. Einstein was also a lifetime pacifist, for which he was heavily discredited in the Nazi propaganda during the 1930s

					<img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/images/einstein-letter.jpg" alt="Einstein's Letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt" />
					<p class="text-justify">
						After learning of the splitting of a uranium atom in a Berlin laboratory, Einstein sent this letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt to encourage the careful watch of activities involving uranium and alert him of the potential for the construction of a powerful bomb

					<img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/images/atomic-bomb.jpg" alt="Atomic Bomb Explosion" />
					<p class="text-justify">
						Einstein's famous equation written over this nuclear explosion depicts the immense amount of energy that a small mass is capable of supplying

					<img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/images/book-burning.jpg" alt="Pile of Smoldering Books" />
					<p class="text-justify">
						In 1930’s Germany, intellectualism was decried. As a result, books from private homes and public libraries were burned in rituals such as these with great zest from crowds of "good Germans"

					<img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/images/fermi.jpg" alt="Enrico Fermi" />
					<p class="text-justify">
						Italy’s top physicist, Enrico Fermi, escaped Mussolini’s fascist government and first settled at Columbia University where from 1939 to 1940, he worked with other physicists including Einstein and Columbia Chemistry Professor Urey (1934 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his discovery of the heavy form of hydrogen known as deuterium) on a federally funded project to find suitable graphite for Fermi's uranium assembly—the beginning steps toward making an atomic bomb

					<img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/images/rabi.gif" alt="I.I. Rabi" />
					<p class="text-justify">
						Theoretical physicist I.I. Rabi was a Columbia University professor and Nobel laureate for his 1944 discovery of nuclear magnetic resonance. His leadership on the Manhattan Project, diplomacy efforts, and frequent European trips were crucial to a successful, collaborative effort

					<p class="text-justify">
						“Little Boy was the name of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945, by the bomber plane Enola Gay, piloted by Colonel Paul Tibbets”
						<span class="text-muted">(Pickover 388)</span>.
						It was a gun-type device with highly enriched uranium as fuel

					<img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/images/fat-man.jpg" alt="Fat Man" />
					<p class="text-justify">
						"Fat Man" was a 10,000-pound implosion-type bomb dropped over Nagasaki, Japan, on Aug. 9, 1945. Its fuel was highly enriched plutonium-239, and it had an explosive force of about 20,000 tons of TNT, about the same as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Because of Nagasaki's hilly terrain, however, the damage was somewhat less extensive than that to the relatively flat Hiroshima

						"The assassination of Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie Chotek, on their state visit to Sarajevo" (Mindich 1). Days after the shooting of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, this original work of art was published in "Le Petit Journal", a French newspaper, and became a famous illustration. For many, this assassination was the beginning of the end of Habsburg rule, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Imperialism; Franz Ferdinand and his wife were driving through Sarajevo, part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in summer 1914, when they were shot by a local Serbian. WWI started not long afterwards, when Austro-Hungary declared war on Serbia

				<div class="image d-inline-block rounded">
					<img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/images/wwi-women.jpg" alt="WWI Women in Factories" />
					<p class="text-justify">
						During WWI, a new workforce was needed to supply the labor in the new industry—weapon making (David 1). Women filled the jobs of making weapons for the war effort. "By May 1915, so serious was the 'shell crisis' that most British guns had been reduced to firing just four shells a day and it seemed as if the war was going to be lost, not in the trenches of Flanders but the factories of Britain" (David 1). The scandal brought down Liberal government in England. "The new ministry set about building munitions factories across the country, and transforming the civilian economy to one completely geared towards war"
						<span class="text-muted">(David 1)</span>.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="image d-inline-block rounded">
					<img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/images/wwii-women.jpg" alt="WWII Women in Factories" />
					<p class="text-justify">
						Again, in WWII, women became the workforce that built the weapons for the war effort, just like they did in WWI (David 1). It is said both WWI and WWII were won in the weapons factories. "The manufacture of munitions played an even bigger role in World War II...In World War II, the Allies dropped 3.4 million tons of bombs across Europe and Asia" (David 1).
						<br />
						"A new, mostly female workforce populated the factories of UK and France to solve a shell crisis that had threatened to defeat the Allies in World War I" (David 1).
						<br />
						"By 1917, thanks to the new munitions factories and the women that worked in them, the British Empire was supplying more than 50 million shells a year. By the end of the war, the British Army alone had fired 170 million shells"
						<span class="text-muted">(David 1)</span>.
