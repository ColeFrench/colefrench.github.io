				<h1>Einstein and the Atomic Age</h1>
				<h3 class="text-muted">How the Greatest Scientific Minds Impacted One of the Most Destructive Events in Human History</h3>
				<h5>By Cole French</h5>
			</div>
			<div class="image d-inline-block">
				<img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/images/pupin.jpg" alt="Pupin Physics Laboratories">
				<p class="text-justify">The work for the Manhattan Project, which aimed to create the first nuclear weapon during World War II as a joint effort between the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada was originally done here in Pupin Physics Laboratories at Columbia University in New York City.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="image d-inline-block">
				<img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/images/einstein.jpg" alt="Albert Einstein">
				<p class="text-justify">Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was the mastermind behind the quintessential equation, E=mc^2. He formulated his famous special theory of relativity in 1905, and most people credit him as the father of the Atomic Age. Einstein was also a lifetime pacifist, for which he was heavily discredited in the Nazi propaganda during the 1930s.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="image d-inline-block">
				<img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/images/einstein-letter.jpg" alt="Einstein's Letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt">
				<p class="text-justify">After learning of the splitting of a uranium atom in a Berlin laboratory, Einstein sent this letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt to encourage the careful watch of activities involving uranium and alert him of the potential for the construction of a powerful bomb.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="image d-inline-block">
				<img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/images/atomic-bomb.jpg" alt="Atomic Bomb Explosion">
				<p class="text-justify">Einstein's famous equation written over this nuclear explosion depicts the immense amount of energy that a small mass is capable of supplying.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="image d-inline-block">
				<img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/images/book-burning.jpg" alt="Pile of Smoldering Books">
				<p class="text-justify">In 1930’s Germany, intellectualism was decried. As a result, books from private homes and public libraries were burned in rituals such as these with great zest from crowds of "good Germans".</p>
			</div>
			<div class="image d-inline-block">
				<img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/images/fermi.jpg" alt="Enrico Fermi">
				<p class="text-justify">Italy’s top physicist, Enrico Fermi, escaped Mussolini’s fascist government and first settled at Columbia University where from 1939 to 1940, he worked with other physicists including Einstein and Columbia Chemistry Professor Urey (1934 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his discovery of the heavy form of hydrogen known as deuterium) on a federally funded project to find suitable graphite for Fermi's uranium assembly—the beginning steps toward making an atomic bomb.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="image d-inline-block">
				<img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/images/rabi.gif" alt="Isidor Rabi">
				<p class="text-justify">Theoretical Physicist Israel Isaac Rabi was a Columbia University Professor and Nobel laureate for his 1944 discovery of nuclear magnetic resonance. His leadership on the Manhattan Project, diplomacy efforts, and frequent European trips were crucial to a successful, collaborative effort.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="image d-inline-block">
				<img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/images/little-boy.jpg" alt="Little Boy">
				<p class="text-justify">“Little Boy was the name of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945, by the bomber plane Enola Gay, piloted by Colonel Paul Tibbets” (Pickover 388). It was a gun-type device with highly enriched uranium as fuel.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="image d-inline-block">
				<img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/images/fat-man.jpg" alt="Fat Man">
				<p class="text-justify">"Fat Man" was a 10,000-pound implosion-type bomb dropped over Nagasaki, Japan, on Aug. 9, 1945. Its fuel was highly enriched plutonium-239, and it had an explosive force of about 20,000 tons of TNT, about the same as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Because of Nagasaki's hilly terrain, however, the damage was somewhat less extensive than that to the relatively flat Hiroshima.</p>
